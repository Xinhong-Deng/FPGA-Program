# FPGA Program

This repository contains mini programs in Arm-based RISC assembly and C language for FPGA DE1-SoC board. It is the course materials for ECSE324: Computer Organization.

## Lab1
- Find largest integer in a range
- Find the range of a list of integer
- Maximum and minimum values of arithmetic expression

## Lab2
- Data exchange in between register and stack with PUSH and POP
- Factorial program with recursive subroutine
- Call C function (calculate min) in assembly subroutine

## Lab3
- Implement a stopwatch application with the board's button as start/stop button and the LED as time display. The time is reset with the board's slide switch.

## Lab4
- Implement a driver for keyboard input
- Implement a driver for monitor VGA output
- Display different colors on monitor with VGA based on the keyboard input

## Lab5
